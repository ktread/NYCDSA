Asher W.,"New York, NY",6/19/2019,5.0,"I've literally walked by ABC kitchen every day for 5 years and said ""I've gotta try that place sometime."" ""I've eaten at every other great restaurant in Flatiron, why haven't I been to ABC?""Well the other night we finally made it to ABC Kitchen, and damn do we regret waiting this long. We started at the bar. I had a marg which I asked them to rim with their adobo chili salt. My girlfriend and her mother drank wine. The marg was solid, great kick from the chipotle infused salt. The bar was very nice. We were seated shortly after. Our waitress (though I can't remember her name) was an absolutely sweetheart. Not only was she kind and funny but very knowledgeable and opinionated when it came to the menu. We love opinionated waiters because any smart diner knows that nobody knows the food better than the people who serve it and eat it daily, so we often ask for advice when we are having an internal dilemma while choosing between various delicious sounding dishes. With her expertise we arrived at the starting line with the carrot avo salad and the pea soup. The carrot avo salad was honestly one of my favorite but simplest things of the night. The salad was light yet had a very developed flavor thanks to the cooking of the carrots and the application of some kind of delicious oil, though I couldn't tell what, as well as a healthy hit of acid. The pea soup was light and vegetal but very flavorful and satisfying thanks to the addition of mint. Next we immersed ourselves in the steamed artichoke. This thing was a hoss. It was basically an artichoke, completely bloomed open like a flower, steamed to perfection until the heart was fork tender and the leaves nice and soft, and then filled almost like you would fill a bowl with about a quarter inch of spices and a mustard vinaigrette. It was buttery and acidic and just all around divine. We dipped the leaves in the center well of vinaigrette then demolished the heart. The whole dish is edible so we didnt leave a scrap beyond the spent leaves. Highly recommended. Definitely my favorite dish of the night. My girlfriend and her mother split the ricotta ravioli and the campanelle with spring peas and pistachio pesto. I didn't try the ravioli but the campanelle was quite good. Cooked well and the peas were left only partially pureed, some whole, so it added lots of texture. Textbook pasta dish. I ate the black sea bass with chilis and potatoes at the advice of our waitress. It says it comes in a herb broth, but I would call this more of a fumè. And thats a good thing. This was a perfectly crispy bass in the lightest but most flavorful broth Ive maybe ever had. Perfectly executed with nice globules of glistening fat floating on the surface. My god it was existential. If you're a fish lover (which I'm not necessarily) you must get this. It was easily one of the top 3 fish dishes I've ever had. The fish was so tender and the broth really just set it apart. We ended with the apricot crumble, which was very tasty, sweet but tart from the apricots. And a cookie plate, which I probably would skip next time in favor of some of the more unique desserts on the menu. Overall, service was excellent. The staff were incredibly helpful and kind. The atmosphere was spot on. And we had a lovely dinner. Will absolutely 100% be back soon."
Jenn L.,"Jersey City, NJ",7/10/2019,4.0,"Came out here for a team lunch reservation. I ordered a Housemade Ricotta Ravioli which was drenched in cheese with a few layers of Ravioli. It was really good, I inhaled that meal in a matter of minutes.I was a bit worried that I would still be hungry because there wasn't a lot of ravioli and I managed to be one of the first ones to finish but I did get full by the end. Partially is most likely due to indulging in bread and family style appetizers prior too. Would rather recommend a burger or something more filling if you're worried about still being hungry.They also offer prefix menus - so I'd probably go for that if I were to go back w/o company pay.Overall, the restaurant has a lovely formal setting and service was great."
Marian M.,"Vicente López, Argentina",7/3/2019,4.0,"I did enjoy very much this restaurant! The deco is amazing, the food was really good, it is in the middle of Union Square. We did had 90 minutes waiting, yes it was long but as we were travelling we did some walking around and came back when they called us and our table was ready.Disfrute muchísimo este restaurante! La deco es divina, la comida muy buena, queda en el medio de Union Square. Si tuvimos 90 minutos de espera, si fue largo pero como estábamos paseando, caminamos un poco por ahí hasta que volvimos porque nos llamaron que nuestra mesa estaba lista."
Brandon E.,"Providence, RI",6/26/2019,4.0,"It was very good - but nothing jumps out from the brunch we had. We sampled most of the options and there were yummy, but tbh, was expecting this to earn the 5th star and just didn't seem to get there in my (overly critical) book. Still worth a visit or two nonetheless!"
Lauren G.,"Bridgewater, NJ",6/3/2019,5.0,"When you walk in it's super romantic - very cabin chic. The smells reminds me of an older fireplace but is so comforting. My one dislike was when we were seated behind us was a store! I'm not sure what storeOpens up into this restaurant but it's a weird design and kind of ruins the romance of it all. What are you going toDo! Space is limited in Manhattan. My cucumber martini was very good. Portion size for appetizers varies but is smaller. We opted to share a bunch of apps instead of ordering meals. Calamari was good, housemade ricotta was phenomenal and the bread was super good and fresh. We ordered the tuna as well which was so fresh! So another disappointment for me was the side of the crab toast- it was one piece of bread cut into 4 pieces. The flavors were on point but it was sooo small! ThisPlace is not cheap by any means but really enjoyed my night here"
Freeyah-Knycky C.,"Brooklyn, NY",5/12/2019,4.0,"I think there are three of them. Three ABCs. I passed through the restaurant of ABC Cocina on my to ABC Kitchen and then the wonderful Emily told me there was also ABCV (the vegan restaurant). ABC Cocina was dimly lit throughout, even making getting to the toilet a serious task on those steps for old four eyes. Back upstairs and had to pass all the couples dining to locate ABC Kitchen and it was like a whole different world. Kitchen is bright and tastefully decorated. (hey there's a decor store above this restaurant, could it be they own errrythang around here?) As I was saying it's chic, modern with a real airy, casual yet elegant feel. From my food selection of crab toast (came highly recommended), calamari and beef burger I enjoyed the burger the best, something I don't say often. Emily said it was some type of special beef but they buried me deep under libations so I cannot to save a life remember a word of what she said about that beef. Emily though, so knowledgeable, accomodating, professional and an overall boss at what she does. Well done sistah! Don't worry, I'ma see your name on my telly soon! Thanks for a wonderful evening. ABC. The End."
Neelum K.,"Jersey City, NJ",6/24/2019,4.0,"This is an awesome place to go with a group.  The service is so generous - they give you all the time you desire and come only when you need them.  I like that!  We were here for 3 hours on a Saturday (you must make a reservation or this is not an option), and tried many items ""family style"".  I LOVED the squash blossom pizza!  OMG I will come back just for that and NOT share it with anyone!  Burger was good, meat and cheese platter was also good.  What is GREAT are the drinks.  I have a feeling everything on the menu here is pretty amazing.  Also, the Union Square farmers market is right there, so its a nice way to spend a Saturday in the city."
Tamira G.,"Brooklyn, NY",5/2/2019,5.0,"The Burger! I'm coming back for it !I went here with a friend on Tuesday night.  I would recommend making reservation..that way you can guarantee yourself and your party a seat. Even though we didn't make reservation we were still seated quickly. The hostesses were really sweet and personable.The decor is beautiful, dim lit and intimate in the main dining room. The cafe has an airy look too it. It is different from the main dining room of ABC Kitchen but it is still nice. Our waiter was very knowledgable and gave us great recommendations.We order the campanelle and pesto. I thought it could use a pinch of salt but was pretty good. NOW the burger that I ordered for my main was soo good. Im afraid Im just going to have to return to have it again. My friend ordered the salmon. It got good reviews. The Chenin Blanc is always my go to and is never a disappointment. The ginger lemon soda came in handy since I have a bit of a sore throat. Overall good reviews from me."
Jose P.,"Washington, DC",4/16/2019,4.0,"After a year we came back to ABC kitchen. I ordered the same dish as last year - bunless burger with a side salad. It did not live up to the one from last year, but still good. I am dropping from 5 to 4 stars for a few reasons. 1. Last year the price for the burger was very high but totally worth it. This year it was still very high priced but it was not as good make it less worth the price. 2. Although all the servers were very nice, we had three different servers. Not sure why they kept shifting but they would always introduce their replacement.  3. The food was still good. 4.  The place is still very nice. Very well decorated."
Tiffanii C.,"New York, NY",4/7/2019,5.0,"Came here with a friend who was visiting the city for Sunday brunch. We made sure to book a reservation ahead of time as I heard about the super long waiting times on Yelp. Nonetheless, we had to wait about 10 minutes or so as our table wasn't ready yet, which wasn't a problem.We got a variety of dishes: Buttermilk and Crawford Cheddar biscuits, Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli, Smoked Salmon with Horseradish, Creme Fraiche and Lemon, and Eggs Benedict with Flying Pigs Farm Ham. I loved each single dish we had (minus the Smoked Salmon as I don't like Smoked Salmon but my friend absolutely loved it!)! The biscuits were buttery, flaky-ish, and overall indulgent in taste and texture. I personally preferred it without the butter but my friend loved it with the addition of butter so definitely try that. You could also really taste the cheddar and overall, it was just an amazing assortment of flavors. I saw that the Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli was a big hit on Yelp and the reviews were right on point! The crab chunks were beautifully fresh, moist (sorry but true), soft, and delicious. The lemon juice added a wonderful tang to the dish as well as the lemon aioli. The buttery toast also gave such a nice crunch and flavor. I highly recommend getting this!The Eggs Benedict was also a wonderful dish. The saltiness of the ham paired with the mildly seasoned egg really went well together. The eggs were perfectly cooked with a beautifully runny yolk. The hollandaise sauce was also really silky and creamy and made the overall dish a flavor bomb. The diced potatoes were also nicely flavored, so I give this dish a huge thumbs up as well!Overall, this is a nice place to dine with visiting friends, relatives, or even with a date hehe. It's not the cheapest restaurant, but the price is worth it in my opinion."
Chris B.,"New York, NY",3/17/2019,5.0,"Love ABC Kitchen! About as good as it gets in this price range for restaurant choices in Manhattan. Perfect place to take a date, huge restaurant with great ambiance, all the items on the menu are unique. Also a good place to take visitors to NYC.The entrance from the street is a little confusing, it's hard to tell which of the three ABC restaurants you are walking into. Service was top notch, and food was delicious. We ordered:crab toast with lemon aioli ($18) - this was so good I forgot to take a picture. It looks like all the other reviews. Must order!shaved raw fluke, apples, horseradish, blood oranges ($19) - creative unique, appetizer. Very delicious and not too unhealthy.faroe island salmon in mushroom crust, lemon emulsion, herbs ($36) - my girlfriend ordered this, she liked it.grilled pork chop, frill mustard with apple mostarda ($37) - I ordered the pork chop and I'm glad I did! The sauce was delicious. Recommendedshaved brussels sprouts slaw, mustard vinaigrette, cranberries, chives ($10) - I've never heard of brussel sprouts slaw before, but this was creative and good. Sorbet for dessert was very good. Overall great experience and will definitely be back. Highly recommended!"
Sonal B.,"New York, NY",6/14/2019,4.0,"Ordered the flat bread and the fish dish. Also ordered the sushi for an appetizer. Love the food, and the Decor the vibes.Also ordered a rhubarb dessert and it was amazing. I'm definitely going there again. It is a bit pricey though, but oh well but a special occasion might be OK"
Masha B.,"Brooklyn, NY",6/7/2019,4.0,"Came here because a wait to Sugarfish was 2 hours...and I was starving. I've had ABC Kitchen on my list for some time so when my friend suggested we check it out - i was more than happy to do so! We were able to get seated at the bar in the back and as we weaved our way through the restaurant towards our seat I 1) realized how cozy and charming this restaurant is and 2) this is literally the perfect restaurant for a date. On to the food - since it's been hot and humid in nyc lately, i haven't been craving heavier dishes/meat so i opted for fish. I generally prefer fish such as salmon, arctic char, but opted for the Black Sea Bass. It was good but i honestly expected more! My friend got the line caught tuna sashimi marinated with ginger and mint and that was super fresh and delicious! The cocktail i got was the ginger margarita and do not think the price ($18) justified the taste. Nothing groundbreaking here. Would probably opt for a glass of wine next time. I definitely will be back to try more things off the menu!"
Rachel G.,"New York, NY",6/10/2019,5.0,I came here for dinner by myself before a show and sat at the bar.  Food starts being served at 5:30 pm.  I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.  The bar area is very pretty.  I had the ravioli and their service was quick.  They were very attentive to me and I enjoyed my dinner and reading during it.  It is not an inexpensive meal but I only had the one entree.  They also gave bread with olive oil.
Marilyn Y.,"New York, NY",6/16/2019,4.0,"Been wanting to come here for a while now and finally made it here last night with my boyfriend for a late dinner around 10 PM! The restaurant itself has a nice rustic ambiance; very farm-chic and romantic. Service throughout was also quick and friendly!We had the pretzel-crusted calamari and tuna sashimi to start - both were delicious!! I was a bigger fan of the tuna sashimi out of the two appetizers - the fish tasted fresh and I enjoyed the sour/citrus-y flavor.For my entree, I had the sea bass, which was replaced with snapper for the evening. I particularly enjoyed the chiles on the dish, and the broth as well! Taking off a star since I actually had wanted to try the salmon, but unfortunately they had sold out of salmon by the time we had arrived. Nevertheless, I hope to be back to try it another time!For dessert, we shared the chocolate cake, and it was the best chocolate cake I've had in a while! I loved the toasted marshmallow icing and the malted chocolate bits. All in all, a great meal! Would expect nothing less of a Jean-Georges Vongerichten restaurant!"
Dina K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3/11/2019,5.0,"Came here with my parents for my birthday dinner and would recommend for any occasion-Service: The service needs to be noted here as it's impeccable. It felt like there was a team of servers all dedicated to helping out the table and no matter who you asked to help, all of them were more than happy to help. Food came quickly, everyone was super friendly, and overall very pleasant Food: Where to start?-Cocktails- got the Citrus Sparkler which definitely focused on the champagne. Also tried the sake which was nice, light, and crisp-Calamari- well fried, thoroughly breaded, delicious -Ricotta - great crusty bread and a good portion of the spread-Fluke and Tuna Sashimis- keeping these together but both had their own flavors and were both amazing, recommend for sure -Sea Bass- this was my meal, well prepared, flakey and great portion size. There was a broth in the bowl that was seasoned with thyme and rosemary and was unlike any preparation I've tried before, very good!-Fried chicken- half chicken deboned and cooked tempura style, was very juicy -Ricotta ravioli- classic and good -Chocolate Cake- super moist and flavorful-Cookie Plate- options for everyone!Atmosphere: The overall restaurant is super different. Everything is different yet somehow it all works together (lights, plates, anything). I appreciated the decor and presentation. A bit dark but otherwise great Would 100% return"
Sherry J.,"Manhattan, NY",4/10/2019,3.0,"What I love:- Bar area with beautiful sunlight coming through the windows- Two or three high top tables- The food actually tastes very good. I had the egg and fried oysters and I would definitely recommend it- The service was really goodProblems:- The interior is very dark, not the best when you come here on a sunny day- They keep people waiting at the front of the restaurant when they have a ton of empty tables around. (Are they not well staffed?)- My friend ordered the kale salad with salmon added on and it was basically a piece of salmon sitting on a plate full of kale. Not worth the $31. There are other restaurants out there that have food that tastes good but at a worthy price."
Matt H.,"Philadelphia, PA",3/4/2019,4.0,"It's been 5 years since I last ate here, but ABC kitchen still delivers. I was pleasantly surprised my group was able to get bar seating on a busy saturday night! The atmosphere is really nice and they have a variety of settings - main dining room has dim lighting that is great for dates, and no matter where you are seated, you'll be surrounded by fresh and modern decor. Likewise, the menu offers dishes with unique and refreshing taste. A few highlights:Crab toast: a delight to share with the table. Honestly I'm not a huge fan of crab to begin with, but this dish really works for me. Pairs well with the lemon aioli.Black Sea bass: Super fresh, and sits in a delicious herb broth. The fish skin was crispy, but otherwise was super moist!Pork Chop: the group's unanimous favorite - they give you a nice thick slab of juicy meat, rich in flavor. The apple mostarda was also tasty and balanced the meat well.Chocolate cake: has ganache in the filling, and has a toasted marshmellow icing - above average chocolate cake for sure!Service isn't the fastest, but the waiters were very polite and professional."
Dianne C.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",7/8/2019,5.0,"What a wonderful dining experience. The food was fresh, delicious, and well portioned. They have great options for sharable appetizers as well as lots of entree choices for everyone's taste buds. The staffs are super helpful with great recommendations. It was an amazing dining experience. Will definitely be back."
Kristie P.,"New York, NY",2/17/2019,4.0,"Had Valentine's Day dinner super late (around 10:30) last week. Service was a bit slow and it took awhile before we got menus or offered  any water. We went with a bottle of Pinot Noir and some apps - crab toast and the shaved raw fluke. The crab was super fresh and served with a fab of what tasted like mayo. The fluke was absolutely delicious, flavor was well balanced with the horseradish and pieces of apple. For the main course, I went with the ricotta ravioli and my boyfriend had the friend chicken. The ravioli was definitely the best part of the meal. They were so fresh and tasted like they had been made by someone's grandmother! The chicken was definitely crispy though a bit bland. The mashed potatoes were super buttery and smooth. We also ordered the cheesecake, which had some sort of sesame crust and fresh blood orange on top. It was okay but very hard to eat, given how soft the crust was. Decor is beautiful, definitely very romantic dinner!"
Kate F.,"Fort Mitchell, KY",2/19/2019,4.0,"Mixed experience.  The hostess situation was bad - she checked us in and forgot we were there for over an hour (until I checked back in with her). Then seated us in the bar - which we specifically said not to.  The service- with Jesus as our main waiter- was very attentive.  The atmosphere is hip.Squash & ricotta app - surprisingly tasty!  My fav part of dinner.Calamari with pretzel app - good but not unique (tasted very typical of calamari).Bolognese pasta - good, though not sure I'd have again.  Spicy (which I like) but the spice took over the meaty flavor of the dish.  The pasta was done right.Sea bass - just not a fan.  Can't explain it, but was served in watery sauce with basil.  The basil overpowered.  The potatoes just didn't need to be there (lacked flavor). Disappointed.  Cookie appetizer - only liked the Malomar.  The rest was too sugary."
Rachel H.,"Simi Valley, CA",6/18/2019,3.0,"We celebrated my 50th Birthday here last week. Our experience was not what we had hoped. During our visit, for ambiance ABC Kitchen deserves 4 stars. For food, 4 stars. For service, 2 stars. We were seated and placed our drink order. We then didn't see our server for what felt like forever. Drink arrived, it was a nice martini. Our server eventually came to take our order, and our appetizer, the tuna sashimi arrived very quickly (brought to us by someone other than our server). It was delicious. Entrees came out soon thereafter but our sides did not. We tried to find our server, but could not so we dug into our entrees. My husband had the fried chicken which was very good and I had the bolognese over strozzapreti, which was tasty but the shape and cut of the pasta made it very awkward to eat. I finally was able to literally flag down the server to ask about the sides, she apologized and said she would get them. Another 10 minutes or so pass, and as she stopped by the table next to us to take their order, she mentioned that our sides were ""coming out now"". They didn't. At least another 10 minutes later, when we were then finished with our entrees, out came the sides. The server never came by the table again during the meal, someone else took our dessert order and brought it to us. The server did bring us the check and here's where things really went off the rail. As I was writing up the tip and and signing the check, she decided to clear our table of the remaining glasses and side plates! Literally hovering over us in an obtrusive way as I wrote up the check (I still gave her over 20%) and clearing things. So, now that we are ready to leave she can finally pay attention to our table? My husband is about as easy going as they come, and he was livid. Her service issues were not just limited to us, the table next to us ordered a bottle of pinot and she brought out two champagne glasses and dropped them and left, then returned quite a while later with a bottle of champagne. They just looked at her like WHAT THE??? The older gentleman had to explain that it was pinot not champagne. It then took a considerable amount of time for her to return with the wine, and they were finished with their entrees. None of this is the end of the world, but we chose ABC for my big milestone birthday because of its reputation. We figured it would be a sure thing. Were it not for the terrible service, it would have been a lovely evening."
Josie L.,"Hartford, CT",5/20/2019,3.0,Honestly hate to give anything but a 5 stars to ABC kitchen because I've been here so many times and it's usually amazing. The last time i went though i got a mushroom pizza with and egg and the pizza was actually wet.As a Brooklyn gal Born and raised i hate when people eat their pizza with a fork but i couldn't even pick this pizza up because it was so soggy. The flavors were great but the texture of the pizza really made it hard to enjoy! Besides the soggy pizza we had the pea soup which i always enjoy and the fluke (i think) crudo. We also had a salad with roasted carrot and avocado which were good too!
Linda W.,"New York, NY",1/28/2019,3.0,"Went for restaurant week last week. A little disappointing I'm not going to lie. Shaved raw fluke with apples and oranges was a complete miss, both taste and presentationThe entree was much better. Salmon on bob salad was cooked to perfection. And the fried chicken with spinach was good as well. They were gracious and just let us sit there for ages while we chatted, but I really was expecting more from the restaurant"
Marwan A.,"Grosse Pointe, MI",7/6/2019,5.0,What a place. Nice vibe. Great food. Excellent service. The food was so delicate and flavorful. Will be on my list for returns. They are vested in the quality of service and food. It shows. Go there!!
Tina W.,"New York, NY",11/27/2018,4.0,"This location is in a prime location - right next to Union Square. And it's spacious.Location: very close to the subway where you can access it easily. Food: basically, ordered everything and nothing disappointed. With wine selection ,their food , and even their dessert are right on point.Service: very considerate and nice. We had lots of request because it's our anneversary and they can accomodate very well.Price: okayThe only disappointment here is their kitchen applications and decorations. The decoration seems to be cheap that it's not as decent as the good.Overall, if you're here looking for food, here it is. If you are here loooking for romance, oh-no, it may not be your top priority here."
Mal C.,"Las Vegas, NV",11/9/2018,3.0,"The food is still delicious and the bussing staff was wonderful, but I extend a 3 star rating because of the waiter that our table had. The waiter was rude from the first encounter. We had a five year old in the group, but he was behaving well and there was no reason to approach us sideways. We decided to share food and when a couple of plates were cleared, a busser visited to remove them. We continued to stack empty plates on the side of our table in order to make space and avoid a mess for our little one. Then, the waiter came and said we don't clear the table until everyone is finished, but in this case I will take them. I live in Las Vegas and hearing this instead of ""how is everything"" and simply removing the items was ridiculous. I felt like we were assumed to not belong in the restaurant, even though we caused no scene or trouble. While I thoroughly enjoyed my experience in 2016, I was disappointed this visit. Of the food we had, the crab toast was the best. Other items were good but not memorable. Our least favorite was the broccoli rabe. The chili was overpowering and the flavor combo was not appealing."
Brittney G.,"Brooklyn, NY",1/3/2019,5.0,"All I can say is wow! This was one of the best meals I've had in awhile! Let's start with the customer service! We were a group of 10 there for our office Christmas party. The menu was personalized along with company name etc. everything was family style so it takes away from having to make a decision and you can just try everything on the menu. The waiters/waitresses went above and beyond. Anything we needed, they accommodated and the execution of this meal was flawless! Let's get on to the food:For the appetizers we had the sashimi tuna, the beet salad, and the ricotta cheese. Oh my god, I have never enjoyed beets but this beet salad was sent by the gods!! The tuna had a perfect flavor combination and the ricotta cheese was brilliantly smooth with a lite flavor. Not as harsh as some ricotta cheeses I've had. We also had the crab toast, the calimari, and the spinach pizza as well as the mushroom pizza. Everything was so fresh and flavorful!For the main courses: we had the pork chop, the ricotta ravioli and the seared salmon. Again, all executed perfectly. The pork chop was paired with spicy apples who've I have never experienced before but was so very pleased! For the sides: we had the mashed potatoes with sea salt, soooo creamy and flavorful!For desserts: we had the chocolate cake, the sundae with caramel pop corn and the almond cake. I was not a huge fan of the desserts I thought they were a bit too complex and needed to push back a bit on the strong flavor. But not bad at all, I didn't eat much of them honestly simply because I was so full from the rest of the meal!Thank you ABC Kitchen for such a pleasant experience! I will be back!"
Benson Y.,"New York, NY",2/25/2019,4.0,"ABC Kitchen is associated with the nearby ABC Carpet and Home.  Known for its cross between modern and classic design sensibilities, its wares are not cheap but they are whimsical and lovely to look at.  However if you ever wanted to have a meal inside the interior of ABC Carpet and Home, ABC Kitchen gives you that chance ! Walking into the restaurant feels like you have walked into a catalog complete with beautiful lighting, furniture and fixtures.  It is an absolutely gorgeous space with a modern, semi-rustic design.I came for a birthday brunch, so I was able to try several dishes.  Here is a rundown:CRAB TOAST WITH LEMON AIOLIThese small pieces of toast each came with a delicious crab salad.  The texture and flavor were both nice and smooth while the aioli gave it a bright ""bite"" of flavor.  Definitely get these!MUSHROOMS, PARMESAN, OREGANO & FARM EGG PIZZAThis small pizza is perfect for 3-4 people to share.  The egg may seem like an odd thing to add to a pizza, but all the flavors come together beautifully to create a very comforting dish.SCRAMBLED EGGS, CRISPY OYSTERS & HOT SAUCE BUTTERLike the egg on pizza above, this is a very unexpected combination of ingredients.  However, they somehow work together beautifully.  The egg was runny, just the way I like them and the crispy oysters offered a delicious contrast in both flavor and texture.  The hot sauce butter tied it all together.  This is a must-order!WOOD OVEN ROASTED MAINE LOBSTER (with Oregano & Lemon-Chili Vinaigrette)This was perhaps one of the most straight forward dishes we ordered.  While good, there was nothing outstanding about it.   It was moist, the vinaigrette was good, but I woul dnot say this is a ""must have"".Service was A+.  Our waiter was funny, attentive and answered all of our questions.  When his shift ended, he made a nice smooth hand off to our second waiter (who was also fantastic).Overall I loved my experience at ABC Kitchen and I cannot wait to go back."
Melissa D.,"Carmel, IN",3/3/2019,4.0,"Fun and great atmosphere. Loved decor and all that the restaurant stands for. The calamari was coated in pretzel crumbs which was very mild tasting but delicious. The crab toast was delicious and unique. Full of flavor and different that the norm of what you ""normally"" get on a menu, it was very light and flavorful. My pasta with bolognese was very good and spicy. So if you don't like spicy then stay clear. The porkchop on the menu was heavenly it was so juicy and tender and the apples added the perfect combo. It was spectacular. Got the shaved brussel spout slaw and it was bland, wouldn't get that again. Our server was super nice, but our service was slow at the same time. Needed to ask for a refill and to have my bread plate cleared after removing everything else. Overall, very minor and would definitely go back."
Ashley H.,"Westminster, CA",10/24/2018,5.0,"We were recommended to this restaurant from a foodie friend, and it did not disappoint. Luckily, we were able to make a reservation a little less than a week in advance. Ambiance - (5/5) It's a beautiful and elegant restaurant. It is very dimly lit but a nice place to have a celebration (birthday, anniversary, etc.). The only thing is that it is pretty hard to read the menu in the dark. Service - (5/5) For a restaurant of this caliber, I expected great service and it deliver. I think that my water was refilled a total of 10 times throughout the entire meal. We were checked on constantly by the staff who were friendly and helpful. Food:Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli - (5/5) This was extremely tasty and loaded with shredded crab meat. The lemon aioli was the perfect touch of citrus and balanced the richness of the crab meat well.Shaved raw fluke, ocean herbs, and fermented green chili - (5/5) This was probably my favorite dish of the night. It was so light and refreshing yet each bite was an explosion of flavor. It was perfectly balanced with fresh herbs and the bits of fruit in the dish were delicious. It was sweet, salty, and sour in the perfect amounts. Line caught Tuna sashimi - (3.5/5) I don't personally like tuna very much. It was really good and like the other sushi dish, it was very refreshing but the flavors weren't as good as the fluke so I would choose that dish over this one. Black sea bass with chilies and herbs - (4/5) The sea bass was cooked perfectly, extremely fresh, and melted in your mouth. While the fish was delicious, the dish is essentially in a soup. I would have preferred the fish to be prepared differently. Sundae with Salted Caramel Ice Cream - (4.5/5) This was incredibly tasty and very salty (in a good way). It's not overly sweet but extremely tasty. The candied peanuts and popcorn were a perfect addition. The whipped cream and hot fudge was delicious. A perfect ending to the meal!"
Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",2/18/2019,4.0,"ABC Kitchen doesn't need any more rave reviews, so I'll keep this short (because I still have things to say, dammit!). - this is the most enormous restaurant ever; I kept on walking and it kept on going. That's great, because it means you'll almost always be seated. There's also a variety of seating options, whether high-top and stool, or round family table, or bar, or regular two- or four-person tables. - taste is not lost on them. The decor is so unique and carefully thought out. Every corner is dripping with style, all within the uniform modern rustic theme.  - customer service is very professional and chivalrous, although slow. - had the mushroom appetizer, the sea bass entree, and the Brussel sprouts side. Everything tasted perfect, though portion sizes were way small, especially for the price, so keep the quality-over-quantity thing in mind when coming here. It's more about the exquisite presentation and the quality ingredients at ABCK. Also tried the kale salad with salmon added to it, which was actually a big portion and very lemony delicious. - special note to not sleep on the vegetables! There's definitely a special vegetable situation happening here! - coffee was great and was refilled as well. They have almond milk, score! Their iced tea looked great, too, though I didn't try it. - love how it's got the home decor extension, so you can take a fun walk after your meal!"
Melissa D.,"Near West Side, Chicago, IL",10/15/2018,5.0,"Chic, modern and rustic restaurant where the food is fresh fresh fresh!!I had made reservations 30 days in advance (crazy but necessary). We arrived to the restaurant early and were not seated until 20 minutes after our reservation time, which was a little frustrating but luckily things turned around from there. We enjoyed a drink in the beautiful bar area until we were seated. The dining room is gorgeous, with lots of white wood, glass, dim lighting and rustic yet modern décor.  To start we ordered the Roast Carrot and Avocado Salad at the recommendation of a friend. I know this does not sound exciting, but it was the most fresh, delicious salad I have had in a long time. Order it! The carrots were roasted perfectly, fresh avocado, crispy seeds, large croutons with a citrus dressing-perfection! They also start you off with complimentary bread as well. We all shared the Fried Organic Chicken, which was special too and not your ordinary fried chicken. The breading was extremely light and crispy, chicken was perfect and juicy as well all sitting in a decadent butter sauce. My other favorite of the night was the Winter Squash Campanelle with parmesan and nutmeg-a perfect dish for fall. I kept having ""one last bite"" and couldn't stop! We also had on the side, the Mashed Potatoes with sea salt, and those were fantastic as well. Rich and decadent!Before arriving I wasn't all that excited about the menu choices and not sure if ABC Kitchen would live up to the hype, but it definitely went beyond my expectations with it's extraordinary twists on their dishes. It was my favorite food while visiting NYC!"
Lauren H.,"New York, NY",3/29/2019,4.0,"Fun, modern and romantic atmosphere.  Crab toast is five stars - wonderful ratio of flavorful crab on perfectly toasted bread.  It is simple and refreshing.  Wasn't as big of a fan of the spinach ricotta pizza, although the texture of the crust was divine, in my opinion the flavor was a little too yeasty and the cheese was a little too strong.  Sea bass was delicious - outside had a nice crust on it and the lemon added a good twist.  The almond cake itself was five stars! However, I think that it would be better paired with a creamier ice cream/sorbet.  The almond and pear garnish enhanced, but the pear sorbet didn't really compliment the cake - it was a little too icy and overpowering.  Perhaps a lighter pear ice cream (or even vanilla or milk flavored) would bring the dish to five stars in my mind.  Will definitely be back to try other items on the menu."
Rachel C.,"Boston, MA",5/27/2019,5.0,Sitting in the restaurant as I am writing this review. Absolutely delicious. Ordered the crab toast and a side of asparagus - the portion sizes are decent so both filled me up. The flavors are top notch and all the food is very fresh. Service is great too!
Serena S.,"New York, NY",10/4/2018,4.0,"I've been here twice before. The first time I came with my friend and our meal was very rushed. We came on a Friday night and they had us in and out within 45 minutes. We felt like we couldn't enjoy our meal. We ordered drinks, appetizers, and mains and they still rushed us through it very quickly. The food was good, but the overall experience that time was a 3/5. The next time I came was on a Thursday and it was definitely a 5/5! We sat there for about 3 hours and enjoyed our meal. The appetizers, wine, and main dishes were all Delicious. Good portions and tasty food! The service was also great and the server was very patient with us while we took our time with ordering and eating! I would recommended the ricotta ravioli and toast with heirloom tomatoes"
Valerie N.,"Manhattan, NY",11/5/2018,4.0,"Strong 4.5 stars! Came in for brunch and reservations were easy to get. The ambiance is lovely and upscale, but not stuffy. I loved the decor with the exposed wood ceiling and the light, open feeling. Service is great too. I had the tuna sashimi appetizer and while the portion is small, the flavor is great! Eggs Benedict with salmon: so so good! The portion was generous for me. There were also potatoes which were good. Freshly squeezed OJ: very good and fresh! Yay! I would certainly come back!"
Hannah M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",8/18/2018,3.0,"Great, but overpriced. The JGV name carries a lot of weight, and in this city, that weight comes along with prices that are about 20% more than they should be. However, I found the value of this place and the quality of the food to be substantially better than the Latin sister ABC Cocina.Went with a large group and split a number of appetizers among the table. My favorites were the roasted beets with yogurt ($14) and the crab toast with lemon aioli ($16). The beets were absolutely phenomenal and the yogurt was unlike any I've had before. The missable dishes were the roast carrot and avocado salad ($17) and the summer squash and arugula salad ($16). Neither were bad, I just found them to be the least-exceptional and most-overpriced of the apps. The pretzel-dusted calamari ($18) was great, but no better than calamari I've had other places. I enjoyed all the appetizers and found, later, that they were the highlight of the meal. We each ordered our own main dish - typically I would have headed straight for the cheeseburger, but being that I was at a business dinner I opted for the cleaner and more sophisticated monkfish ($34), which was served alongside summer squash, tomatoes, and basil. I had only had monkfish once before when it was one of the choices for the catch of the day at Seamore's, but remembered liking it. I'm not sure if it was something in the fish itself or the flavoring, but I was unimpressed, both by the dish and the portion size. For dessert, we again passed around a number of dishes. The best, by far, were the blueberry pie with goat milk ice cream and lavender ($13) and the peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream ($12). The almond cake and chocolate cake (the latter especially) were remarkably dry and bland. The interior is awesome and clearly adorned with pieces from ABC Carpet & Home. Service was professional but not stiff. All in all, I've found the JGV's restaurants excel with fruits and veggies but have yet to master meats/fishes/etc. Will try abcV at some point to test my logic."
Suzanna H.,"Queens, NY",8/12/2018,5.0,"Came here for restaurant week. Food;You get complimentary bread. I would recommend accepting it as you can dip it into the amazing sauce from the shaved raw fluke appetizer. For the appetizer I got the Shaved raw fluke with market radishes, picked green strawberries and herbs. This was my favorite. The presentation was on point and was consistent with top quality and price. Beautiful assortment of colors, flavors, textures and finesse. This was an insta worthy dish. You are pretty much eating a garden with beautiful little flowers. The flavors we're sophisticated and blended so well together. This dish was a perfectly light and refreshing dish for the summer season. For the main course I got the seared salmon on the Bibb salad with market vegetables and a spicy buttermilk-herb vinaigrette. It was okay. It was certainly quite big and very filling. The food tasted fresh with good quality ingredients but I thought it could have been more creative. The vinaigrette reminded me of some sort of spicy ranch sauce and that wasn't something I expected in this type of establishment. So food wise, get the shaved raw fluke.Service; This was wonderful. The server was super nice and helpful. The water was constantly refilled. The dish was covered to keep it warm when I went to the bathroom. Overall just amazing service."
Matt M.,"Brooklyn, NY",10/14/2018,4.0,"What can I possibly write that hasn't already been written about this NYC institution?!  ABC Kitchen captures what hospitality is all about:  warm, attentive, and generous service; great food; and a terrific ambiance.  The space itself is absolutely breathtaking.We dined at ABC for Saturday brunch.   My girlfriend was a bit indecisive in her choice of wine and our friendly and knowledgeable waiter was able to guide us through their wine menu.  He even offered a tasting prior to making a selection!  I decided to be boring and ordered a cup of coffee - one of the best cups of coffee I've had in the city.For starters, we shared the Crab Toast with Lemon Aoli.  The crab was fresh, delicious, and well dressed (solid portion size too).  Definitely the highlight of our meal.  For mains, we ordered the Eggs Benedict with Flying Pigs Farm Ham and the Cabbage and Apple Salad.  The Eggs Benedict was amazing.  The yolk was perfectly runny, the muffin was homemade, and the chef piled on a heaping serving of some damn good ham.  Unfortunately, the salad fell short.  The dish was too acidic owing to the vinegar and the cashew yogurt didn't really pop.  Perhaps poor dish selection.  If it weren't for the salad mishap I would have rated this place five stars."
Roselle B.,"Aiea, HI",3/5/2019,4.0,walking in you feel like you're in a designer home like the ones that the famous HGTV couples designed and made lol. beautiful interior! decor is homey and inviting. the food is absolutely delicious! great selections. yes definitely on the pricey side though. the one thing that really stuck out to me is their apple pie. best one i've had ever! but seems like it's seasonal because i went back couple of times and it's not on menu anymore. i just feel bad for anyone who didn't try it! haha. definitely recommend this place. you'll have a great experience.
Stephen C.,"Cincinnati, OH",9/3/2018,5.0,"Coming from the Midwest, my expectations were not very high for a 'farm to table concept' in the middle of Manhattan.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurants ability to serve up traditional American fare (much of which is sourced organically and locally) and at the same time provide a contemporary twist on these dishes.Huge fan of the interior environment, a mixture of modern and rustic.  I love the spacious seating arrangements - probably one of the most spacious, private seating arrangements for four I have experienced in an popular manhattan restaurant.  Food is exactly what I would expect from a farm to table concept - traditional dishes with focus on fresh organic ingredients. Appetizers - calamari is awesome - fresh, not chewy, and perfect amount of outside crisp.  Crab toast is probably their most popular appetizers - it was very good - overflowing with crab meat and they allow the crab to shine with low seasoning / mayonnaise.  Cheese and meat board was also good - appreciated how the waiter spent a good deal of time explaining the sourcing and preparation of each item.  Roasted carrot salad was also very good and would recommend for a share.Entrees - hands down the fried chicken is the best dish on the menu - and probably is one of the best in the city.  Super juicy chicken breast and an amazing light breading around it.  The breading is so light and crispy I thought it was a cream puff outside initially.    The pork chop is probably my number 2 on the menu.  Beautifully prepared with the perfect cook and seasoning.  Sea bass closely follows the pork chop, and would be a great lighter fare option.  Wrapped up the meal with a decadent blue berry cobbler with a side of goat milk ice cream.  I usually am not a fan of anything goat related - however the added sharpness to the ice cream as the perfect compliment to the sweet cobbler.Awesome meal. Highly recommend.  Use open table to book in advance as they get very busy.  Will be back."
Avi P.,"West Sacramento, CA",2/23/2019,3.0,"Hey ABC kitchen, thank you for the warming service. No complains!! I gave a 3 stars review because of 2 things that bothered me-At first, the acoustic at the restaurant is kinda hard to adjust to, i had to speak veryyy loud to hear my friendSecondly, i ordered the veggie burger which came in a pita and I think that for $22 + tip I expected much more. 2 burgers and 2 small pitas would have been much nicer and money worth instead of this one burger and gigantic pita with barely any vegetables on the side."
Lianna T.,"New York, NY",10/5/2018,3.0,"I made a reservation weeks in advance to celebrate my mother's birthday at ABC Kitchen (her choice) and am so disappointed that the restaurant did not live up to our expectations. We had been years ago for lunch and had so enjoyed the atmosphere. The restaurant is set inside the store and has beautifully mismatched plates and an overall modern but chic decor. The atmosphere was still lovely, but the chaos, noisy-ness, and slow service made for an overall unenjoyable dinner. When I called, I had informed them it was my mother's birthday and was so pleased that they said they could bring out a birthday cupcake and candle at the end of the meal. However, we were seated at a table in the middle of the dining room - and it was so loud we could barely hear each other even when shouting. We ordered the new-to-the- menu cabbage and apple salad with apple cider vinegar and walnut dressing and the sea bass entree to split. The salad was okay - an interesting combination of flavors, but something I felt could be recreated in a home kitchen and with a more sizable portion. The sea bass was quite good as the fish tasted fresh, flaky and flavorful. While the meal was okay - waiting for our orders to be taken, the food to come, and then the plates to be cleared was frustratingly slow. The restaurant was filled with waiters, but getting the attention of any one felt impossible. By the time we finished our courses, spent ten minutes trying to get our plates cleared, another ten trying to get the dessert menu, and another ten trying to place our order, my mother decided she would enjoy a dessert in a calmer, less chaotic environment. The birthday cupcake never came and we left the restaurant feeling frustrated and with slight headaches. Overall, the food was good, but honestly not worth the largely disorienting, loud, and frustrating experience that was supposed to be a calm and happy celebration."
Rebekah C.,"Great Neck, NY",5/27/2019,5.0,You walk into the doors and a beautiful space with candles and flowers awaits for you! We made a reservation and got seated right away. The food came out pretty quickly one by one. Since we were sharing it felt like a course meal. Every one of them were so good. They also use organic or locally produced ingredients. Don't forget to get the sundae for dessert even though you are full! It is the right amount of sweetness.
Carline D.,"Manhattan, NY",1/13/2019,5.0,"Had brunch here and made reservations for some friends and I.  The host, waitstaff and ambience was awesome.  The food choices were yummy and clean.  I had the roasted salad and avocado salad...delish!  My brunch entree was scrambled egged with fried oysters with a side salad.  Also, indulged in a Grapefruit Mimosa, a cocktail and some tea.  We all split a chocolate cake with ganache and marshmallow frosting. I was thoroughly satisfied and will be eating here again."
Leng Leng Y.,"Manhattan, NY",7/26/2018,5.0,"Food: One of the best culinary experiences I have had for a while. Every dish was perfectly crafted to stimulate the right senses! I came here for restaurant week and had the raw fluke (highly recommended!) -- absolutely flavorful and refreshing for the summer. For the entree I ordered the salmon salad which was perfectly cooked medium rare and that dressing though... Drinks: Wow I am impressed with the cocktails! I did not expect their drinks to be as good as their food items! The barrio paloma was perfectly mixed and recommended for mexcal lovers or not! They have a huge wine list but could not pass up the cocktails!Vibe: Elegant, boutique, and its located inside a department store. What else could you ask for?"
Aaron F.,"Mesa, AZ",1/3/2019,5.0,"A posh, country styled eatery that features organic dishes on a fun atmosphere.  Enjoy a mid day brunch with biscuits and jelly doughnuts.  The juices are succulent and if you can reserve the large wooden table, I highly recommend it."
Kaitlin M.,"Seattle, WA",7/13/2018,4.0,"Delicious food, elegant decor, and terrific waitstaff. Our waitress was super sweet and attentive and gave great recommendations.My good friend and I ordered appetizers, entrees, and desserts and it was ALL delicious. You can't go wrong here. The Housemade Ricotta with Strawberry Compote and Grilled Bread was super tasty and the Black Sea Bass was SO flavorful.Per my friend's recommendation, we ordered the sundae for dessert; salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts and popcorn, topped with whipped cream and hot fudge. Amazing--a wonderful way to end the meal."
Wenye X.,"New York, NY",7/4/2018,4.0,"Finally! I have always wanted to come here, but it is pretty hard to get a reservation here on weekend. I got the famous crab toast and the roasted carrot salad. My boyfriend got a pasta entree. The crab toast is bomb! There is so much crab meat on the toast, and toast is well toasted. The overall taste is so refreshing! I do wish the portion is a bit bigger though. The salad is also amazing: the roasted carrots are sweet and the dressing is also spot on! Definitely one of my favorite salads in nyc. My boyfriend loved his pasta a lot, but I find it a bit too spicy and cheesy. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and is quite spacious. It is good for a healthy yummy meal. Will come back!"
Sola E.,"Kearny, NJ",5/24/2019,5.0,"The service is hot, welcoming and fantastic. Plate, forks and other dinnerware is rustic but elegant. Cooked seafood, a must try here, is cooked in chicken stock hence has deeper flavor than ordinary restaurant. Fried chicken fills your every fantasy of fried poultry cuisine: crispiness, tenderness and finishing touches of spicy butter sauce. Black sea bass is of too much salt in broth, nevertheless its crispy fish skin orchestrate the broth and tangy topping into a harmony of taste finesse.ABC kitchen is a restaurant known for sourcing local and organic ingredients. But who says one cannot get rustic dishes and elegant style at once?"
Melissa S.,"Houston, TX",2/3/2019,5.0,"One of my favorite restaurants in NYC. Consistently excellent service a food year after year. You definitely need to make reservations in advance as this restaurant is a staple for trendy dinning. On my most recent visit, I mixed up the times of the reservation and arrived 1 1/2 hours late...they were understanding and still able to accommodate us. Food while a little pricy is delicious and I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menus. I highly recommend the grab toast and salmon (if on the menu)."
Andrew L.,"Chicago, IL",8/5/2018,5.0,"We came here for dinner Saturday night, place was packed. We had a reservation, would recommend.The place looks like it should be on Pinterest. It probably is. Sometimes places with very trendy aesthetics don't actually have great food. That was not the issue here. The pretzel dusted calamari was very tender. I didn't think pretzel dusting added much to it, but fried squid is delicious so I wasn't upset about it.I, like most basic white girls, must have my carbs. We ordered two pastas, and two pizzas. We got the ricotta ravioli since our waiter described them as ""little pockets of joy"". He wasn't wrong. We also got the fettuccine. My god those noodles were good. They were the perfect thickness and texture. Soaked up the pesto sauce really well. I think this pasta was easily top 3 pastas of my life.The thin pizzas were also very tasty. Structurally didn't hold up super well but was still good. I actually really enjoyed the crust of these pizzas too. They killed it with the carbs here.We also had the Black Sea bass. I think that the quality of the fish, and the technique it was prepared with was superb. It was so tender and just melted in your mouth. I do think that the sauce with it was that flavorful. It might have been intentionally more mild, but I'm not a mild man.No true dining experience is complete without dessert. If you disagree, that's fine. You're just wrong and I hate you. We had a slice of the s'mores chocolate cake. Loved the toasted marshmallow on it because it's toasted marshmallow. Great way to end the meal."
Mary F.,"Arlington, VA",3/14/2019,1.0,"This was one of the most disappointing dining experiences I've had in a very long time. My parents had been wanting me to try this place for a long time and as they'd been before and loved it. I was visiting for the weekend and we decided to go.We made reservation for Saturday brunch and arrived a little before our reservation time. There was about a 10 minute wait for the table which is common and responsible. The restaurant is wonderfully decorated and has a good ambiance. That's where the good things stop.Once we are sat at our table in the main dining room, we were not brought water or menus until we had been at our table for 15 minutes. We FINALLY received menus and water only to be ignored for another 10 minutes.At this point we had been at our table for 25 minutes and had not been able to order anything, even drinks. We weren't even sure if we had a server. After many attempts, I finally managed to flag down some poor employee and begged for some bread and someone to come take our order. He disappears and comes back with bread and the bartender who promptly asked us what we wanted. We were not sat anywhere close to the bar area so I'm still confused how he was the only person available to take a order.Out food comes out within a responsible amount of time and is bland and lukewarm. The only item we liked was the pretzel coated calamari. The eggs on the eggs Benedict were all massively over cooked. Everything lacked flavor. Nothing was hot. No server at any point checked on us. The only employees we interacted with were the food runners and the water-guys. Getting our check was another 15 minute process of trying to flag someone down. We never figured out who our server was.The final ""cherry"" on top was when someone (who maybe was the manager?) came over while we were paying to ask how our meal was. We answered ""not good"". Her response was ""oh"" before walking away. I'm not sure why she even asked. No one apologized to us at any point. For a restaurant with such a good reputation I expected a lot better. We will not be back."
Rebecca D.,"New York, NY",7/9/2018,4.0,"This place was so cute! I love the atmosphere and the place settings. I love the decor, and that they have the fresh vegetables out and you can see them. Our table unanimously decided that this place was ""shabby chic.""We could only get a reservation for 6 people at 5:30pm. I called in advance the same day to see if we could get a later reservation and they told us we could come at 6 but we had to leave by 8 for the next table. I appreciated that they let us come a little later. One of our guests was not able to make it which we let them know when we revised the time of the reservation.When we did finally get there, it upset me that with a larger table of 5 that they wouldn't let us sit till the whole party was there. Who else are you going to give this table to? They also told us on the phone we had to be out by 8 for the next reservation at that table and we wanted to get started! But to no avail.  I would like to note that my table did have a weird request for the food (switching a sauce on a pasta dish) to which the kitchen graciously obliged. We really appreciated that they were willing to do this for us.Regarding service:Overall I was surprised at how slow the service was, and how infrequently we saw our server. I asked the guy that brought out our food for a few things a few times, but he had to send the waiter over. Also, after our appetizers, we had to wait a really long time for our main courses.  Regarding the food:roast carrot and avocado salad, crunchy seeds, creme fraiche and citrus 17 - amazing. Perfect avocado. kale salad with lemon, serrano chilies and mint $17 - it was just a kale salad ‍Fluke crudo - was light and bright - good flavors and texture. Really enjoyed it. Pea soup - it was a lot thinner than I was expecting and was served warm. Was almost like a pea broth. I would have preferred it thicker. Pasta with peas, pesto, parmesan - was good. Ravioli- the guests at my table wanted the ravioli with the pesto sauce instead of the red sauce. They were kind enough to accommodate for us. It was actually really good with the substitution. Chocolate cake - melted chocolate ganache and toasted marshmallow icing. It was okay. The icing was more marshmallow than icing. I couldn't taste the malt at all. Overall a solid meal. I would come back.  The decor was my favorite."
Kelly L.,"Mobile, AL",6/20/2019,5.0,Excellent food and service. Visited the restaurant for my brother's birthday for lunch. Dustin was our waiter/bartender and he was outstanding!
Quincy V.,"Scarsdale, NY",6/6/2019,4.0,Excellent and very healthy.  Three separate restaurants with three separate menus.  Great place for lunch.
Izzo C.,"New York, NY",4/8/2018,2.0,"UGGGHHH!!!!really wondering if we picked a bad night, or if people are too blinded by the novelty of this place to rate it fairly.i should've smelled the fishiness when the lady on the phone urged us against making a reservation earlier that day for later that evening (presidents day - a monday), reassuring us that the wait would be fine; the adamance seemed kind of weird, but i didn't think much of it at the time. upon arrival, we were told that it would be 45 mins and that we could chill over by the back bar for the time being -- hmm ok, no biggie...except for the fact that it actually ended up taking 70 MINS and that we NEVER made it to the back bar because the host never got back to us!!we hoped that these little blunders would be redeemed by a better dinner, but that thought quickly dwindled when it took speaking with 3 different servers to place our orders. entrees were pretty good, but not to the extent to which i can justify them not filling us up. dessert was more or less satisfactory (would recommend the chocolate creme brulee), but took too long to come out to be thoroughly enjoyable. cmon ABC......"
Shalane K.,"New York, NY",5/1/2019,5.0,"It took a while for me to snag a Saturday night dinner reservation, but it was well worth the wait! I had the fried chicken over greens with hot sauce butter. The serving size was very generous, chicken was tender and juicy covered in a panko-like coating, and the hot sauce butter perfectly balanced out the dish. The atmosphere was pretty and upscale without being pretentious. ABC Kitchen is a new favorite!"
Ashley L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7/6/2019,5.0,"Had a wonderful experience here. The ambiance is great. Had some red wine, the crab toast, ricotta, the burger, the pork chop, and the salmon, and they were all excellent. The sundae for dessert! Very yummy and will definitely go back."
Elei Z.,"New York, NY",5/6/2018,4.0,"Food good, service terrible. The place is big and can get crowded and noisy, so it gets loud. The tables are pretty tightly packed together, but hey, it's new york. The service is way too slow. They need to be more productive and efficient. Or maybe the problem is too few staff. I don't know. But as a customer, I was continually frustrated by the super slow and inattentive service.One time, I ordered the lobster & egg. And then they brought out a completely different dish because they didn't have the lobster dish anymore. The problem was they didn't let me know. Instead they charged me for an egg dish I never meant to order. They should've let me know beforehand so that I could've replaced it with something else or just cancelled the dish. They often made mistakes with our drinks. Got the wrong drink at lunch, asked for the right drink and it just never came. A different time for dinner, a similar situation happened - we got the wrong drinks and we also randomly got drinks we never ordered...  they really need to step it up. It's a pity because I like the food but just can't stand the service. The food's always delightful - doesn't seem to matter what you get off the menu,. For brunch, I especially enjoyed the calamari. The sauce was  sweet and the calamari was light and crispy. Many times when I get calamari (at various places), it always comes too oily and either too soft or too hard. The pieces are usually too large and not sufficiently bite sized. And the calamari is often times too chewy. But at ABC Kitchen, it was delicate but with a satisfying crunch. The french toast was also very good. Very fluffy and egg-y and soft. I thought it was a little too sweet though. But overall, great french toast. The egg looks pretty plain - after all, it's just egg. But it was so good. Every bite was a burst of flavor."
Ashley V.,"Brooklyn, NY",4/8/2018,5.0,"Coming here really feels like a treat. The interior is so cute and cozy, the servers were attentive and the food was phenomenal. I came with a group and we were able to sample quite a few things:Cured Meats & Cheeses: I felt like this was just okay. If you're wanting some apps to share I'd probably pass on this one. Nothing was wrong with it, I just wasn't blown away.3/5Crab Toast: this was super light and delicious. Just the right amount of acidity. Would recommend.4/5Butternut Squash Toast: I think this had ricotta on it but I can't remember the type of cheese 100% (the menu recently switched and I no longer see this option.) That being said, this was by far my favorite appetizer of the night! A little sweet, a little salty, and I truly wished I didn't have to share this one with the group.5/5Tuna Sashimi w/Ginger & Mint: another huge hit. I could've eaten an entire order of this by myself. The marinade was to die for and the fish was super fresh.5/5Pretzel Calamari: a little underwhelming. You couldn't really tell the breading was pretzel (and I never would have guessed if the menu didn't say so). To be fair, I like calamari but it isn't a must order for me, so the fact that this didn't really feel special puts it lower on my list. It just seemed like regular fried calamari to me.3/5Tomato/Mozz/Basil Pizza: a classic dish done well. Everyone loved this and finished the pie with no complaints.4/5Ricotta Ravioli: someone else at my table ordered this and I was drooling over it all night. You get a fair amount of ravioli and this was definitely a nice, hearty dish.4/5Wood Oven Roasted Lobster: OH MY GOODNESS! I ordered this for my entree and I loved it so much, I could've eaten two. It's seasoned with oregano and a lemon-chili vinaigrette which made the taste really intersting, unique, and not something you'd normally expect from lobster. It was different (in a good way) and I'm totally here for it. Best lobster I've had in a long while, and it was both seasoned and cooked to perfection.6/5 Broccoli Rabe: delicious and a good way to sneak some veggies in! It had a chili sauce on it but I couldn't really taste it.3/5Mashed Potatoes: so creamy and flavorful. Order a few for the table, because everyone will want seconds.5/5Overall, I'd definitely come back here. I love that the menu is seasonal so you get to try a few new things that are fresh and in-season. Can't wait for my next ABC dining experience."
Alexandra T.,"Jersey City, NJ",10/20/2018,4.0,"Had been dying to try ABC Kitchen for 2 yrs and finally made it for my birthday with two gal pals on a Wed evening at 8pm. I made the reservation on open table 2-3 weeks before and didn't have a problem picking a time. As we walked in, we were seated promptly, which I always appreciate! The spot is surprisingly enormous. The fact that it is so hard to get a res here with ample seating is insane, but a great sign that there's always high demand.We started out with a bottle of chianti. It was reasonably priced for a notable restaurant in NYC. We started out with the house made ricotta and fig jam as well as the roasted carrot and avo salad. The house made ricotta was super fresh and creamy and was balanced perfectly with the sweet fig jam. The smooth textures of the jam and ricotta went so well with the toasted crostini. The roasted carrot and avo salad was surprisingly flavorful; loved how such simple ingredients had so much flavor!For my main course, I got the full portion of the campanelle in a tomato sauce with buratta, cherry tomatoes, and sausage. The campanelle was homeade and absolutely delicious!For my bday, we also split the chocolate cake, which was HUGE and phenomenal. Would definitely come back and try some of the wood fired pizzas, pretzel dusted calamari app and some different fish or meat entrees. The only complaint my group had about our experience was the poor service. We felt undermined by our waiter from the moment he spoke to us. He clearly didn't give us enough time to look over the menu and then came back every few minutes to see if we were ready yet. There was no reason for him to rush us and he could have used his social awareness skills to not ask us 4-5 times if we were ready to order within 15 min. He was also not friendly throughout the meal. When it came time to order dessert, he made a comment that the menus were on the table the entire dinner and seemed annoyed that we hadn't realized. For a meal that takes long to get a reservation and isn't cheap, I expect service to be top-notch and it was completely unacceptable that we weren't treated in a warm or respectful manner."
Kimberly T.,"New York, NY",4/19/2018,3.0,"This place is so difficult to get a reservation at, and the decor/table setup are beautiful. The food, though good, is nothing that memorable -- it's high quality ingredients and well-cooked, but there's nothing that distinctive about the dishes that make it that different from other meals I've had in the past. My entree (the sea bass) was juicy/tender, but didn't have too much flavor.The restaurant itself is beautiful and the service is nice."
Victor D.,"New York, NY",6/2/2018,2.0,"Wow I came here hearing that it's really hard to get reservations and I managed to get one! Imagine how excited I am to try it.We got the crab toast, fried chicken, and crispy pork confit, and fettuccine.The crab toast, like all others have said, is the best item and you have to get it. It's basically some buttered crab on some well toasted bread. I don't think it's particularly hard to make...but it is very tasty.The fried chicken, now that was very interesting. The fried chicken itself sits on some spinach and spicy sauce, so it reminds you of southern fried chicken. What's so unique about this chicken is that it's a large piece that has no bones! How is that possible?? Well they stitch together  chicken breast and thigh to make this possible. So some part of the chicken will be more dry than the others. As for the battering, it's a very light batter. I thought this was an interesting dish, but I didn't think it was particularly good.... Note, if you are sharing this dish make sure you don't just get caught with the red meat or white meat as that makes the experience very different :DThe pork confit wasn't that special either. There are two different kinds of pork. One is the main dish, a bit on the dry side. That's probably why there's mashed potatoes around it. Then there's a more saucy/asiany style pork belly. That is very firm and also very dry. Not that great....The fettecuni was really good. I lied, this is probably my favorite dish from the meal. The pasta itself was so good, it's firm and strong and it feels so fresh. There are a lot of fresh ingredients like the pesto, peas, and other veggies.  Overall this place was a huge disappointment given how good it was supposed to be. Wouldn't recommend spending a decent amount of money here."
Crystal P.,"Boston, MA",11/21/2018,5.0,"We booked a large group dinner here for my birthday. Quick response, and very easy booking process. We chose from a list of items for each course and everything was amazing. For market table we got squash toast, crab toast, and roasted beets. My favorite were the two roasts but the beets were also great. For apps we got roasted carrot salad, kale salad, calamari, and ricotta. My favorite was the carrot salad. For entrees we got ravioli, salmon, fried chicken, and pork chop. The best was the fried chicken and salmon. For dessert, we finished off with chocolate cake, almond cake, and sundae. If you can, get all three! They were all so amazing and so different in their own way. Can't wait to come back!"
Ms F.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",2/27/2019,3.0,"Nostalgia plays a funny trick on you. This used to be one of my favorite restaurants, but I don't remember the food being this salty! If you are in the mood for good eclectic food, then go here. It's a great place for sharing plates, like tapas style. That way you can taste everything. I've been here on and off couple of times over the years. You are better off sticking to what's popular: like that carrot and avocado salad, their pizzas. Avoid the squash pasta: one word salty. I had the steamed skate: the skate was really fresh but it was drowning in the soy sauce broth. It made me wish I had rice with that...I don't remember even the roasted carrot and avocado salad being that heavily flavored or salty. The last time I ordered that salad was 8 years ago. From nostalgia, I remember the food being very light in comparison.Then again, the last time I actually dined there was nearly 4-5 years ago. The menu has stayed the same but I feel everything is now over salted... I'm not sure I would go back. Maybe I'd come back just for their pizzas."
Lillian Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",8/30/2018,4.0,"Food: 4/5Ambiance: 4/5Service: 4/5Value: 3.5/5I've been here a few times over the years, and nothing is quite ""wrong"" with this place but the food doesn't excite me. I also find some items overpriced. This is (I think) an older JG restaurant, and the menu reflects what was 'en vogue"" 10+ years ago. However, the space itself is completely modern and beautiful. Crab Toast (5/5) is something I could eat all the time, the crab is so fresh and sweet! Calamari (4/5) is fine, it's not the crunchiest and I didn't detect ""pretzels"" but the dipping sauces are good. Kale salad (4/5) is quite zingy but really needs a few more elements to justify $17. Fettucine with beans and pesto (3.5/5) is just pretty boring. I liked the summer squash pizza (4/5) much better - the crust was crisped almost as if fried. I wouldn't recommend the Black sea bass (3/5) unless you are dieting... served in a too-salty clear broth like a chinese steamed fish preparation. Definitely go for some fried chicken though (5/5). It was one of my favorite things, the exterior is ULTRA crisp and light. I was also a fan of the pork chop (4.5/5), a well-cooked thick slab with classically good pairings of cherry and crispy onions. I dared not order a side vegetable again, last time our greens were literally 4 bites. Save room for dessert. A large slice of chocolate cake (5/5) is airy and bouncy; the crumbly almond cake (5/5) is surprisingly addicting; and the sundae is the salty sugary dessert bomb to satisfy sweet tooths. TLDR: a solid safe spot for taking the parents, last-min special events, and a good option in this area. You'll have a good meal, very good service, but you might forget what you ate by next week."
Jaimee A.,"Manhattan, NY",2/20/2018,2.0,"This restaurant needs a serious menu change!We have been here multiple times and this time it didn't thrill. The service was friendly and the space was beautiful but the food..... Meh.We had:- Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli - Good.  When we initially saw this, we were surprised it was still on the menu after all this time, after the rest of the meal we were glad it was there.- Cured Meats and Local Cheese - Meats were good, cheeses were so so. One of them was so ammoniated that I mentioned it to the waitress. She said the chef told her ""it was supposed to be."" Seriously? We have eaten at Artisanal and Picholine, places with amazing cheese courses. Ammoniated is not something you strive for. It means the cheese has sat too long and is past its prime.- Roasted Beets with Yogurt - Tasty- Mushroom, Parmesan, Oregano and Farm Egg Pizza - Yuck! We have had it before and it was very good. This time it was ridiculously loaded with what tasted like boiled mushrooms. Last time, it had a good amount of mushrooms, but this was insane. There was no parmesan and very little egg. It tasted like boiled mushrooms. - Roasted Acorn Squash - Could have been good, but every third mouthful had a very strong spice that burned our mouths.- Almond Cake - Good but basic.This was a disappointing dining experience and I don't think we will be back."
Marissa G.,"Chicago, IL",3/4/2019,5.0,"My group came to ABC kitchen last minute with no reservation (whoops) and they still found a way to get us a seat rather quickly. I'm glad they did because I loved every dish. The tuna sashimi was unexpected but amazing and flavorful. Same with the fluke, I can't decide which was better. The lobster dish did not disappoint, but was also relatively classic. Cookie plate was a fun ending, would recommend!"
Jay G.,"West Babylon, NY",3/2/2019,1.0,"I was so excited to check this place out because of the reviews and general hype, but dad to say it was probably one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. We ordered the meat and cheese platter to start and the prosciutto smelled a bit weird and had excess fat on it. When I told one of the employees, they told me that's the way it comes. I come from a meat and cheese background and that's not how it's supposed to be. I asked for crackers but they said the best they had was toasted bread, but even that came out extremely burnt. Our drinks were watered way down. My friends ravioli had one peice of burned or over cooked ravioli. And the burger I ordered medium well was medium at best. Fries were coldish and droopy. Within 35 minutes we paid the check and left. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It may have been great at one time, but can't say the same now."
Liz S.,"New York, NY",8/8/2018,5.0,"ABC Kitchen is just a little too popular (and pricey) for me. However, it's the best of the ABCs and I accept that it's a vanguard of the NYC dining scene.The host at the front had excellent people skills and dealt gracefully with having to tell pretty much everyone that their tables were ""almost ready."" We waited about 15 minutes for our table on a 7:30 reservation; I maintain that the ABCs overbook their tables. Bartenders were also great and transferred our tab easily to the table. The bar area is nice, with a tastefully distressed mirror, and there were actually a decent amount of people eating in the area, though it seemed a bit noisy to me.I started with the Barrio Paloma ($16), which fits my usual love of tequila drinks, though it is on the spicy side. My other drink of the night was a glass of minutolo ($14), which was a new grape to me but delicious. It's an unbelievably cheap bottle for retail though, and one of the first time I've seen a glass over the price of a bottle!I started with the signature crab toast ($16), which had a nice pure crab flavor on a toasty bread, and a generous amount of it. The squeeze of lemon really elevates it.Black sea bass ($34) was hands down one of the best fish I've had in a restaurant. Soft flesh, crispy skin, beautiful broth. It irks me that fish is so often seen as the boring choice (and they certainly don't make it sound too exciting on the menu) when it can be so completely flavorful. Just loved this.We also had a side of broccoli rabe ($11), which had a ""fresno chili sauce"" that I mistook for pure sriricha. They actually do a great job with double whammy of the tough texture and the bitter taste that rabe typically has, but I wouldn't say you need it.Service seamless, pacing natural. The decor here is more romantic and less try-hard than the other two ABCs. Just a nice spot with a buzzing atmosphere.It's all very simple and farm-to-table in a way that feels outmoded now, and you feel a bit silly paying these prices (it was over $100 per person with 2 drink, a starter, and a main), so it's easy to discount the experience, especially given my mixed experience with V (and to a lesser extent Cocina).However, everything was excellently done. Maintaining this level of quality is difficult, and based on Yelp and people I know who come here regularly they seem to do it. I choose to round up from a 4.5."
Greg P.,"Wrentham, MA",4/10/2019,5.0,Had dinner here with a group of people from work and had a truly fantastic experience.   The six of us shared a variety of appetizers all of which were spectacular.  Great flavors - both expected and unexpected.  Service was friendly and helpful but never intrusive.  The ginger margarita tastes very fresh.  I'd highly recommend it.  Pork chop entree was really flavorful and cooked perfectly.   Place is on the noisier side but has a very lively vibe which made it ok.  Original plan was to go somewhere else.  I'm very happy that the plan changed!
Mike B.,"Washington, DC",2/24/2018,5.0,"We finally fulfilled a longtime ambition when we sauntered through the door of ABC kitchen. We enjoyed the ricotta with pear and grilled bread appetizer.  The rich, creamy cheese paired well with the sweet, but slightly tangy fruit.We split the fettuccine and pistachio pesto as a first course. This dish combined fresh pasta with tasty nuts. I highly recommend it. For my main, I went with the pork confit accompanied by bacon. It was pure porcine perfection! The confit preparation results in tender,  moist pork, a meat which in lesser restaurants can be in danger of tasting dry."
Emi B.,"Manhattan, NY",3/9/2018,5.0,Never fail!Chicken liver toast and crab toast - LoveHake- so good! LoveMushroom pizza- good!Friend calamari- so crispy and fresh !What else I can say? You know!
Conor S.,"Seattle, WA",9/29/2018,5.0,Mmmmm yum! Really enjoyed this place for lunch. Lots of options and we tried a free things. Coffee was good. The ravioli was amazing and so were the roasted carrots. I would highly recommend this place to someone visiting New York. The service was amazing. Food was fresh and everything went off without a hitch.
Gaurang G.,"New York, NY",4/6/2019,5.0,Amazing restaurant! Must have:1. Ricotta cheese with grilled bread2. Ricotta ravioli 3. Margarita pizza is one of the best I have ever eaten - super lite!!! (Next time: will order 2 of these )Radish with different butters - very interesting but will not repeat.
Ellen L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5/15/2019,5.0,Fabulous. Bar none the best plant-based food in town!!  And beautiful and cheerful too !  Can't wait to return!
Jerrius J.,"Bronx, North Hempstead, NY",1/29/2018,5.0,"Set a reservation for 5 at 1:30pm about a week before we ate there. This was a good idea because when we arrived it filled to the brink.  When I first arrived, only part of the group was there but they let us get seated before the whole group, what a nice privilege! The decor of abc kitchen was unique and chic (I think that's how you use that word).  The flowers on each table were new daily and it was the little things like that which sets this restaurant apart from your average lunch/dinner spot; the details.  What I ordered was: Butternut Squash soup, Seared Salmon on a bibb salad, and seasonal cookie plate. While we waited for our order, they brought out a sourdough bread which was cold (I am not sure why it was not toasted or put in an oven) and oil. It was actually find of funny, he poured the oil in a little plate and waiter was even impressed with his pour! The food:Butternut Squash Soup: absolutely incredible.  The actual temp of the soup was probably 10 degrees too hot so I needed to wait for it to cool down but I couldn't stop myself, I burnt my tongue twice! The sea salt with whatever nut combined with the creme fraiche (dollop of sour cream) was just a combination I was not mentally prepared for.  I am not sure it would fill me up but if I could, I would want to eat this soup weekly till I was put 6 feet underground.Seared Salmon with bibb salad: Easily the best salmon I have ever had in my 22 years on this earth. I got my cooked medium well which meant that it was fully cooked in the middle but before they served it, they put it on a stove of oil and made it crunchy which unbelievable. Then it comes to the bibb salad (that means that they take giant leaves of lettuce and that is the green part) with cut avocado in tiny pieces with thinly sliced carrots and radishes.  The dressing had kick but also sweet. The combination of salad with the salmon was too much for me. I could not handle the flavors, it was TOO good! When I asked my friends about it, we each thought we could eat this piece of salmon with the dressing every day till we died; what a piece of salmon! Cookie Plate: pretty average. You got a chocolate chip, shortbread with apricot in the middle, sugar cookie and some weird one with a jam in it.  I will say, you can see the picture of the Lemon tart and I think that dessert was the best! Something about lemon tart with a nice crust that makes my mouth water! Overall: The abc restaurants are incredible and during restaurant week they are a steal for the quality and the service! They changed our plates and sliverware between courses which I was impressed by! The type of plates were different for all of us and that was the final touch to a wonderful meal! (Claps his hands to the whole crew)!"
Georgianna K.,"Long Beach, CA",6/4/2019,5.0,"We always include a nite at ABC Kitchen when we visit NYC.The Pizza is ""The Best"", and of course, everything is delicious."
