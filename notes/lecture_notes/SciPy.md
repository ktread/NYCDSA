  # SciPy
  
  * Columns called "Features"
  * Datasets in dicts
  
  ## Distributions
  * 1D and 2D Guassian (normal) Distributions
  * Useful for Hypothesis tests, t-tests, etc
  * Returns t and p values
  
  ## Hypothesis 
  * Null hyp = no sig difference between itself and the sample set
  * Alternative hyp = there is a difference
  * p-value = confidence that there is a low probability between populations
    * the chance that our sample set is signficantly different than the population mean
    * doesn't prove Ho is true - just the h1 chance has a low probabilty of selecting it
  * ANOVA
    * analysis of variance test
    * two sample t-test 
    * usese multiple sample sets
