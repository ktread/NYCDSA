  ## Data Science Overview
  
  ### Surpervised Learning 
   * Data with response
  
  ### Unsupervised learning
   * Data without response
   * Community detection/clustering
   
   
  ### Machine Learning in Business
    * Classification
    * Linear Regression
    * Deviation Detection
    * Clustering
    * Association Rule Discovery
      "Beer and Diaper" - two items are highly associated
