### Python 

* Return functions are used by the program which can use the result
* Printing is for your eyes only
* Classes are typically written with first letter capitalized\
* Importing "*" is generally not a good idea since it can overwrite existing values/variables 
* A package is a collection of modules 

int / int = float
int // int = floor (integer division)
float / int = float
num % num = modulus (remainder)
num ** num = exponents

## Named Functions

* def fnname(): let's interpreter know you're about to enter a function 
* Function is over when indentation is back to the left 
* functions do not need to have a return statement 

## Lambda (anon functions)

* Lambda format 
  * lambda arguement(s): return statement
  * lambda always returns - if you don't want a return a lambda function is likely not a good idea
