# Question: Using bnames and births, how many Vivianâ€™s were born in each of

### If only one name is interested, filter first to gain efficiency

# Order the data by proportion of the name instead
bnames %>%

#### wrong way (because of inner join):
bnames %>%
  filter(name=='Vivian') %>%  
  inner_join(births, by=c('year','sex')) %>%
  group_by(name, year) %>%  
  summarise(
    vivian_count = sum(round(prop * births)),
    baby_count = sum(births)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(vivian_count/baby_count) )%>%
  head()



# Side issue: order of the grouping factor matters
bnames %>%
  inner_join(births, by=c('year','sex')) %>%
  group_by(name, year) %>%
  summarise(total=sum(prop*births)) %>% 
  summarise(sum(total))

bnames %>%
  inner_join(births, by=c('year','sex')) %>%
  group_by(year, name) %>%
  summarise(total=sum(prop*births)) %>% 
  summarise(sum(total))
